# Fatou 2

A GPU fractal renderer using Vulkan and a CEF gui.

Most fractals are based on orbit traps, e.g., Newton and Mandelbrot fractals.

-   You can find the C++-based renderer in `/fatou-desktop/src`. The typescript-based CEF-GUI can be found in `/gui/src`.
-   The folder `web` contains a stand-alone WebGL-based version of the project.
-   The [the first version](https://github.com/Agapanthus/fatou) of fatou was written purely in C++ and used OpenGL.

This project will not be continued; I might start a rewrite in the future using Rust and wgpu.
