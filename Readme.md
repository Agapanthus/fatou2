# Fatou 2

A performance-oriented fractal-renderer using Vulkan and a CEF gui based on my original project [Fatou](https://github.com/Agapanthus/fatou).

You can find the C++-based renderer in `/fatou-desktop/src`. The typescript-based GUI can be found in `/src`.

This project will not be continued; a future version might be based on rust and wgpu.
